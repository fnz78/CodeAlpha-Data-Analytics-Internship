# CodeAlpha-Data-Analytics-Internship

This repository contains all tasks completed during the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship.  
The project demonstrates the complete data workflow:

• Web Scraping

• Data Cleaning

• Data Visualization

• Data Storytelling

• Insight Extraction

Each task builds on the previous one to create a structured and professional data analysis pipeline.


🧩 **Task 1 – Web Scraping**

🎯 Objective

Extract book data from an online bookstore website using Python.

🛠 Tools Used

• Python

• requests

• BeautifulSoup

• Pandas

📥 Data Collected

• Book Title

• Price

• Rating

• Availability

📌 Process

• Sent HTTP request to the website.

• Parsed HTML using BeautifulSoup.

• Extracted required elements.

• Structured the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

• Saved the dataset as:

books_data.csv
✅ Outcome

Successfully scraped structured book data ready for preprocessing and analysis.


**🧹 Task 2 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

🎯 Objective

Transform raw scraped data into clean, analysis-ready format.

🛠 Tools Used

• Python

• Pandas

🔄 Cleaning Steps

1️. Price Cleaning

• Removed currency symbols (£)

• Converted values to float

2️. Rating Conversion

Converted text ratings:

• One → 1
• Two → 2
• Three → 3
• Four → 4
• Five → 5

3️. Data Type Verification

Ensured:

• Price → float

• Rating → integer

4️. Missing Values Check

Verified dataset completeness.

📁 Output

Saved cleaned dataset as:

cleaned_books_data.csv

✅ Outcome

Dataset prepared for visualization and analysis.

**📊 Task 3 – Data Visualization & Storytelling**

🎯 Objective

Transform cleaned data into meaningful visual insights.

🛠 Tools Used

• Python

• Pandas

• Matplotlib

• Seaborn

📈 Visualizations Created
1️. Price Distribution (Histogram)

Shows clustering of book prices.

Insight:
• Most books are priced between £40–£60.
• Very few extreme price values observed.

2️. Rating Distribution (Count Plot)

Displays frequency of each rating level.

Insight:
• Rating 3 appears most frequently.
• Very few 1-star books present.

3️. Price vs Rating (Boxplot)

Shows price spread across rating categories.

Insight:
• Prices overlap significantly across ratings.
• Higher rating does not necessarily mean higher price.

4️. Average Price by Rating (Bar Chart)

Clear comparison of mean price per rating.

Insight:
• No strong upward price trend as rating increases.

5️. Top 5 Most Expensive Books

Highlights highest-priced books.

Insight:
• A small subset of books dominate the higher price range.

6️. Correlation Heatmap

Analyzes numerical relationships.

Insight:
• Weak correlation between price and rating.

📖 Final Data Story

From the visual exploration:

• Book prices are concentrated in a mid-range cluster.

• Rating 3 is the most common rating category.

• There is no strong correlation between rating and price.

• Higher-rated books are not significantly more expensive.

• The dataset shows stable and moderate price variation.

Overall, pricing appears independent of rating quality in this dataset.

**🏁 Conclusion**

This internship project provided hands-on experience across the full data analytics pipeline — from raw data extraction to structured storytelling through visualization.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in Python-based data analysis, improved my understanding of data preprocessing, and developed the ability to communicate insights clearly through visual storytelling.

The project reflects practical application of data analytics concepts in a structured and professional workflow.
